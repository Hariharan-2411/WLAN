# üõ°Ô∏è INSE 6190 - Wireless Network Security

A team project submitted for the course **INSE 6190 Wireless Network Security** under the supervision of **Professor Dr. Ayda Basyouni** at Concordia University. This project demonstrates various Wi-Fi security attacks and countermeasures using practical lab environments.

## üîç Overview

This project explores real-world wireless LAN security vulnerabilities through controlled simulations and attack demonstrations. Key topics covered include:

- Deauthentication Attacks
- WPA Handshake Capture & Password Recovery
- DNS Spoofing through Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- Rogue Access Point Setup and Traffic Interception
